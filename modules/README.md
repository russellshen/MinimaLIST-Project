# Modules [README.md]

## **TBD:**
- Preface,
- EngLISP as an intermediate language and its formal-scientific grounding,
- Systematic critique of neoclassical economics from a Marxist angle,
- A MinimaLIST 8-treatment approach to psychopharmacology,
- 4+4 MinimaLIST approach to life planning,
- Etc., including the Afterword at some point.
  - Note that these are just the starting topics within the 4 theoretical domains, not a
    complete covering of the full treatment I will give them with this project.

## **General principles:**
- I will have the forward-facing part of the MinimaLIST project displayed here as a network of
  interlinked article-modules, starting from a shared Preface explaining the general MinimaLIST
  method that at the end diverges into four paths as the concrete particular application
  of the MinimaLIST heuristic approach to each of my 4 intellectual domains.
- There is also a shared Afterword because all paths converge on the same culminating insight.
- These are not traditional linear book paths but the set of valid topological orderings of
  the directed acyclic graph (DAG) formed by the interlinked article-modules.
- Each article-module will state and link to its conceptual dependencies which must be understood to
  grasp the current one.
- Each definition, argument, and explanation will only be given once in the modular system, and if
  it pops up again elsewhere in the DAG, it will provide a link back to the original source.
- This way, I only need to update anything in just one place, saving time, preventing bugs, and
  reducing redundancy that may cause misconceptions when different topological orderings of the DAG
  give slightly different versions of the same idea.
- The commit history on all public branches will be the backward-facing philological
  documentation of the project's progress, but importantly, only the documentation since
  I rebased the project onto GitHub on 2025-10-14, because the documentation prior to that
  date is inside and/or will be inside the /appendix folder due to coming from a variety of
  platforms, including Medium, Google Drive, and ChatGPT.
