# Modules

**TBD:**
- I will have the forward-facing MinimaLIST project displayed here as interlinked modules,
starting from a shared Preface explaining the general MinimaLIST method that at the end
diverges into four paths as the concrete particular application of the MinimaLIST approach
to each of my 4 intellectual domains.
