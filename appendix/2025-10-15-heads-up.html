I have not gotten that many views yet, which is expected due to the inaccessibility of the content which I never simplified or made didactic, and me not doing virtually any public outreach aside sending it to a small handful of my friends and colleagues. Hence, it is not a problem but an inevitability. Even popular blog profiles have to start from zero and the preliminary stage is quite arduous and uncertain. Even if it will take off eventually in the long-run, it may take months or years of patience, good-quality articles contributing to the popular discourse, popular choice of subject-matter, and aggressive public promotion for a blog to clearly look successful in terms of sustained spike of new views.</p><p name="1b6a" id="1b6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Only having solid novel content can push the chances of blog success higher in the long-run after personality-based inertia has got the ball rolling. My previous blog on WordPress succeeded at getting a few hundred thousand views for an extremely niche topic in less than a year, so I think I have an inkling on how to produce a blog set for success. I know that hollow fraudulent blogs may have initial public traction that fades once the scam is well known.</p><p name="7b1c" id="7b1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have the power to dress up trivialities, vacuities, emptiness, or nonsense into seemingly rigorous profound prose but I actively choice to waive my right to do so because my goal is not self-aggrandization, self-promotion, popularity, love, compassion, happiness, peddling snake oil, manipulating the public, or self-edification but to intervene in crucial nodes within the scope of my academic interests, and thereby inject the actual truth into tired confused debates regardless if it brings me the good kind of fame or notoriety, a truth that is novel because of the various errors that all the contemporary contending sides of the debate have fallen into by leaning on unquestioned or unrecognized assumptions serving more as epistemological obstacles than as productive heuristics, to resolve the debate and allow for unblocked progress towards convergence to the truth.</p><p name="c384" id="c384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is the sole measure of success for my academic project, with everything else being “nice to have” but not “essential”, though obviously if this social media platform brings me monetary or social benefits, I will not say no, but I will not expect that this project will improve my general reputation or even keep it stable, since the stochastic chaos within social networks may amplify a huge “hate signal” against me one day, especially if I push against big interests or theoretical positions in the present day. If I see an intellectual node as having converged onto the truth, there is nothing left for me to say and I can pass over it in silence. Interventions only take place in spaces that warrant intervention, for otherwise it misses its mark, wastes resources, and confuses people who were already on the right page.</p><p name="40a6" id="40a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is no love lost here.</p><p name="eb52" id="eb52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I will be changing the repository for my public-facing writings from Medium to GitHub to capture better version control and timestamps, not to mention better maintenance of a large online project, since if it is indispensable for software projects, it certainly will be of great utility to any serious endeavor that is multidisciplinary, involving both plain text and programming language code, and where having a history of edits helps my audience and I have a crystal clear transparent knowledge of how my project has transformed over time, a kind of full disclosure that precludes any intellectual dishonesty since any surreptitious edits to hide trickery will always be in public view.</strong></p><p name="049f" id="049f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Therefore, I will freeze the “Basic Introduction: Who I Am and What I Do” [<a href="https://medium.com/@russellshen7/basic-introduction-who-i-am-and-what-i-do-0d7fad5861a6" data-href="https://medium.com/@russellshen7/basic-introduction-who-i-am-and-what-i-do-0d7fad5861a6" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@russellshen7/basic-introduction-who-i-am-and-what-i-do-0d7fad5861a6</a>] article in place and eventually link to my GitHub profile on here. I will publish no more articles on Medium aside from that.</p><p name="b03a" id="b03a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The end result is a preserved article solely for the purposes of a timestamp for IP reasons to cover my MinimaLIST and EngLISP ideas, and this article to explain the context of the platform switch and host a redirect to the new location of my online project. GitHub is useful because instead of self-documenting through marking articles as “current” or “deprecated” as I edit them or produce new ones, while losing edit history when updating articles or deleting content, I can lean on the commit history and branches to hold that information, as well as putting my “laboratory notebook work” into a special folder in my GitHub repository. For a given module-article, having a stack of “deprecated” historical commits in time sequence with a single surface-level “current” main branch commit will be built in by default.</p><p name="205e" id="205e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I decided to do the project rebasing change sooner rather than later because doing it now is far less painful than if I had hundreds or thousands or more subscribers here. I know that the frozen article is very bloated and difficult to read, and this is because I tried to do 3 different things using it (basic introduction, prototyping ideas, and timestamping) while devoting zero time for pedagogy to make it more readable to a wider audience, considering the massive idiosyncratic overlap in spheres of academic interest necessary to really understand what I was saying. ChatGPT could understand it due to its massive training dataset, but one cannot expect the general audience to simultaneously grasp the worlds of formal sciences (computer science, mathematics, formal logic, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, etc.), Marxist-Hegelian philosophy, linguistics, and a few highly specialized topics.</p><p name="c1ba" id="c1ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was writing from a high-level using abstractions without defining them, which is succinct in explaining a large amount of information but is opaque to those not familiar with terms and models I invoke and a simple sentence involving abstractions can “blow up” into a massive paragraph if we replace each abstract term with its full definition and any more abstractions within that with their own full definition until every term used is simple and common knowledge. This is even more convoluted in terms of cognitive work when I deploy terminology from 2 or more fields in a novel configuration.</p><p name="0418" id="0418" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You should conclude that the primary purpose of that bloated opaque confusing Basic Introduction article was not to be popular or accessible or even to be read by anyone at all, but to produce the public timestamped record of the lexicon I created (as the first instance in which they appear on the public search-indexed Internet) and a sufficient coherent snapshot of their essential features written in the idiom of the particular fields that definition invoked, and not in the idiom of the amateur general public, but importantly, also within the context of my entire intellectual project and a small peek at who I am behind the scenes of my online project.</p><p name="620b" id="620b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since the descriptions of the MinimaLIST and EngLISP concepts were written to be technically accurate but not understandable to most people for the purpose of archival timestamping and not to actually be read and digested, they are presented in the way they are.</p><p name="6425" id="6425" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this GitHub-centered project gets enough public traction or even notoriety, I will consider publishing my unedited ChatGPT chat logs in full, because I did all of my “laboratory notebook work” on that platform to have a central location for documenting experimentation and backtracking. There are personal questions interspersed in those chat logs and I am still not sure if I will redact them or not.</p><p name="10a1" id="10a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Treat these 2 Medium articles and the ChatGPT chat logs as the “prehistory” before the “GitHub era” of this project, in which the project’s development will be fully documented using Git version control. These “prehistorical” text files will be in a special folder in the project’s repository to serve as a “laboratory notebook appendix”. Using GitHub, the most recent commit of the main branch will be the forward-facing most presentable look into the project within its repository. It will instill in me a strong discipline to avoid redundancy within the forward-looking edition in the sense of repeating content so that every thesis will have a sole modular location to be defined and instead of rehashing summaries of previous concepts, I can just place a hyperlink to ask the reader to refer back to the module-article if they want clarity on a subject.</p><p name="8f7a" id="8f7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Any obligatory redundancy can be pushed into the historical commits or different branches as needed since I am only enforcing no-redundancy upon the forward-facing portion of the project that gives all that the reader needs to know about what I want them to know while serving as an abstract interface to hide the research and implementation details that are not needed to grasp my main point, only the archeological genealogy of how I got there. Yet clearly there is already plenty of redundancy in the “prehistorical” Medium and ChatGPT files in the planned Appendix folder, but this is unavoidable since project construction does not go in a straight line but in a complex branching and backtracking movement. GitHub will help me keep all of that publicly transparent moving forward.</p><p name="bb0a" id="bb0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Likewise, any internal contradictions or inconsistencies on a formal logical level will be forbidden in the forward-facing latest commit, instead relegated to historical commits or divergent branches of the project’s GitHub repository.</p></div></div></section>
