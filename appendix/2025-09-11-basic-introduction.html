It is the minimally sufficient set of abstractions that condenses the semantic content possessed by all human natural languages, containing nothing that is arbitrarily or incidentally found in particular languages only. It is an abstraction, i.e., on a higher level of generality. Treat it as an interface with respect to natural languages so that one can operate on semantic content in front of this interface with its numerous possible syntactic implementations hidden behind the interface.</p><blockquote name="a78d" id="a78d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Warning:</em></strong> I invoke X-bar notation syntax trees and Lisp S-expressions repeatedly, but they are beyond the scope of this paper, and I do not want to repeat or paraphrase what others have said many times before me, so I would invite readers to get familiar with them through the usual sources so that the following makes sense.</blockquote><p name="d661" id="d661" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Lisp S-expression structure is not arbitrary: I chose it it is the simplest, most regular, and most universalizable way to express the X-bar notation syntax trees that all natural languages have in common, with an isomorphism between X-bar trees and Lisp S-expressions. Additionally, English written using formal Lisp rules and the proper metaprogramming “preprocessing” compiles as correct Lisp code, making it readable by humans and machines.</p><p name="97f4" id="97f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lisp is the natural expression of syntax trees and it gives us many useful formalistic properties. It dissolves the convoluted grammatical rulebooks for natural languages down to something that is simpler than any human language but still expressive enough to say anything that can be said (Wittgenstein), without a drop of syntactic complexity or ambiguity remaining. As a Turing-complete programming language family, Lisp programs can compute everything that can be computed by any other Turing-equivalent programming language.</p><p name="e2c3" id="e2c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">EngLISP thus reveals the deep formal homology between any language understandable by humans and any language which can be compiled or interpreted by a computer, just as Lisp S-expressions are a thin wrapper over lambda calculus, equivalently expressive as Turing computational models, and express the “code = data” homoiconicity that enables effortless metaprogramming, especially due to how regular Lisp’s syntax is compared to every other programming language whose arbitrarily particular syntactic rules prevent them from achieving homoiconicity.</p><p name="28dc" id="28dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again, the relationship between X-bar trees in linguistics and Lisp S-expressions is isomorphic, but the relationship between EngLISP and well-formed English is a homologous relationship in that the former is one-to-one but the latter is a one-to-many relationship created through transformation, yet easily verified by seeing the many English sentences as different ways to write the same semantic content using different words and ordering. This means that instead of having each English sentence get interpreted into a distinct EngLISP code snippet, a true one-to-one relationship, I produce a coerced canonical format that mandatorily forces English sentences with the same semantic content despite surface-level syntactic variations down to the exact same Lisp S-expression each time.</p><p name="b0a6" id="b0a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hypothetically, this could be done by converting raw English into X-bar notation syntax trees, manipulating them into a regular form that I will have to define strictly as a formal grammar, and then producing an S-expression which as a nested set of atomic pairs is exactly one-to-one and isomorphic with X-bar trees. When I say “canonical”, I mean that every unique semantic snippet of content should always have the same formal representation, and when I say “coerced”, I mean that my EngLISP interpreter will guarantee and enforce that every natural language plaintext input that possesses the same common underlying semantic content will be interpreted into the same X-bar syntax tree and hence the same S-expression in Lisp.</p><p name="caab" id="caab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Note that Lisp is a functional programming language, meaning “function-first”, revolving around dialectical processes that call each other and especially stateless processes with no side effects and no global state in which functions produce results purely based on the results of the functions within its body, unlike most popular well-used programming languages which buy into the object-oriented programming paradigm, or at the very least the imperative programming style of C-based languages, making them “object-first” and revolving around creating and destroying objects, as well as accessing and changing the state of objects.</p><p name="1176" id="1176" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">English is SVO (subject-verb-object), so we have to artificially turn English into VSO or “verb-first” (perhaps even “verb-centered” in terms of verbs being first-order citizens and nouns and others being second-order citizens) to produce the same ordering as is baked into Lisp, because functions in programming languages tend to correspond to verbs in human language anyways and objects with state tend to correspond to nouns in human languages. “Noun-first” paradigms which make nouns first-order citizens, just like with object-oriented programming languages, may make it somewhat more difficult to express highly dialectical thoughts without lapsing back into the mode of creating, destroying, accessing, and mutating objects with a type hierarchy.</p><p name="1d9f" id="1d9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I will add to and explain the profound consequences of this dichotomy in a future article.</strong></p><p name="7ee7" id="7ee7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since the core ruleset for Lisp syntax is already as simplistic and barebones as possible, which grants us these nice aforementioned formal-scientific properties, and also serves as a “neutral” encoding between the “philosophies” of different human languages that choose very divergent syntactic representations, the formal grammar reduces to a tractable problem, which is for each English word with an indispensable meaning to have a formal definition, like “(define x …)”, and if it is a verb or a noun to define what parameters it takes and in which order, like the English verb “produce” taking first a subject doing the producing, the object being produced, and a few optional modifiers giving time, space, and other contexts encoded into natural languages. We could get something like: “(produce I (bagel plural) yesterday)” for “I produced bagels yesterday”. I could have rendered “I” as “1st-person” as well.</p><p name="7e6d" id="7e6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I plan on handling these issues by doing a lightweight minimalist metaprogramming extension of a standard Lisp dialect so that having that on board is all that is needed to write correct EngLISP that compiles without needing to do the heavy scaffolding to make EngLISP expressions compatible with base Lisp dialects, like Scheme, Common Lisp, or Clojure, because I outsourced that chore to myself. These dialects are, respectively, the minimalistic barebones educational version, the one that is popular and has libraries but is not as “pure” as Scheme, and the one that is in the Java ecosystem and compiles to Java bytecode that runs on the JVM. Lisp is very well-known for how powerful it is at metaprogramming as a consequence of its “code = data” invariant property, letting it manipulate itself as language just like any other kind of data.</p><p name="dc1c" id="dc1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “happy path” of conventional well-formed English should not be that difficult to transform into Lisp, but it is all the edge cases that will prove challenging for the EngLISP interpreter. The 80–20 rule will probably assert itself so that 80% of EngLISP input cases take 20% of engineer time, money, or lines of code, whereas 20% of EngLISP input cases take 80% of engineer time, money, or lines of code.</p><p name="b6de" id="b6de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I chose to call this idea “EngLISP” because it was a catchy pun between “English” and “Lisp”, but this is an arbitrary design choice since I know English the best and it is the current most popular language. It is conceivable to do this in any human natural language and still maintain the same expressiveness as in English, but this task will be simpler for more analytic or isolating languages. English does have conjugations and affixes that make things somewhat harder, but I think it is “good enough” considering the real world social properties of English, especially its ubiquity globally and recognition as the unspoken canonical language of academia.</p><p name="6f7f" id="6f7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Using the English lexicon as the default convention for code and data is a pragmatic move to ensure that EngLISP is as easy for Anglophones to read as possible. One could use a different lexicon or even variable_1, variable_2, but only using English lexicon maximizes the chance of being understood as natural language even though the underlying Lisp S-expressions are the same. This enforces the “intermediate language” property of EngLISP simultaneously being casually understandable as a natural language and rigorously able to be compiled as a programming language. However, the compiler will compile correct Lisp code anyways regardless of how the programmer names the code and data. Likewise, due to human fuzziness in cognition and higher tolerance for error relative to computers, many technically-malformed EngLISP examples will be totally understandable by English speakers while causing the computer’s compiler to throw an error, since the human will have commonsensical intuition to infer what exact semantic content the other side intended.</p><p name="0b1b" id="0b1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Incorrectly-written EngLISP may cause different human readers to attribute to it many slightly-off or even mutually-incompatible underlying semantic foundations, which produces the ambiguity that I designed EngLISP to minimize or ideally eliminate.</p><p name="a560" id="a560" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet this goal is only achievable when people use it properly by the standards I will define as a formal grammar, which is for humans, and eventually a full-on interpreter or compiler as a metaprogramming extension of existing Lisp family programming languages, which is for computers.</p><p name="e2b1" id="e2b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hope to prove that an EngLISP computer program or code snippet that compiles correctly produces some formal proof-theoretic guarantees on how rigorously unambiguous and exact it is when read as a natural language text in the sense of linguists and philosophers.</p><blockquote name="2f97" id="2f97" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Duly Note:</em></strong> After translating natural language text into EngLISP, such as for the purposes of feeding it into the LLM architecture wherever one would have fed it natural language text corpuses or user prompts in the pre-EngLISP world, there is a difference between (1) leaving EngLISP in its Lisp S-expression format and manipulating it as-is similarly as one would have had the LLM trace syntactic patterns in raw human language, i.e., representing the Lisp code as just a plain text file just like with human language text files but only with a peculiar nested parenthetical format and ordering for the LLM to trace patterns within instead, and (2) compiling EngLISP, which if successful would demonstrate the logical consistency of the code but not necessarily its truth-value, and when executed could be used to output some useful value, like a Boolean True/False for whether the set of statements is indeed true or not, or a number or piece of text depending on the specific content of the EngLISP encoding.</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="a977" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="70cc" id="70cc" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Instead of a traditional linearly-ordered book series, I plan on gradually publishing and updating HTML topic modules for an academic project that will apply the universal MinimaLIST method to the individual topics that I care about within each of my 4 listed intellectual interests to eliminate epistemological obstacles that prevented a clear view of that topic and make them clear in a way not done before.

After explaining EngLISP in full, I will incrementally “descend 4 stories” down to the MinimaLIST programmatic “ground floor” to uncover the bottom level of my formal architecture, whose problematic was opened by EngLISP but closed after hitting foundational “rock bottom” in which it is not possible to descend any deeper.</p><p name="a8d7" id="a8d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4th floor: Abstract/Concrete defined in terms of sets of sets or subsets of sets respectively in Lisp S-expressions handily where raw primitive sense-percepts, which are not referrable alone, are automatically grouped into subsets of primitives, that can overlap, as first-order objects that can have a name or be anonymous, with higher-order objects being sets of objects and recursive sets of sets. To zoom in and out becomes intuitive as we go towards the most particular and hence take a subset of the current set, like a particular apple among all the objects of the “apple” type, or towards the most general and hence make a set to group together existing sets, up to the simple set of all primitives which expresses the abstract concept of “Being”, with the null set hence being “Nothing”.</p><p name="d468" id="d468" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3rd floor: Dividing computational models into 2 broad classes, which I call dialectical (lambda calculus, breadth-first search, functional programming, induction, action, etc.) and metaphysical (Turing computer, depth-first search, object-oriented programming, deduction, perception, etc.).</p><p name="a3db" id="a3db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2nd floor: Consolidation of many computational processor units into a single discrete agent-like entity when they share the same formalization or Godel encoding or binary addition “ID code” allowing for clear and intended information-passing instead of clashing chaotic noisy units that do not act as a single discrete agent.</p><p name="243d" id="243d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1st floor: The MinimaLIST Universal Loop of 4 consisting of ever-repeating 4 movements, always in the same order, that encompass the entirety of what it means to be an agent-like entity, whether humans or silicon hardware programmed to actively engage with the real world using artificial intelligence and machine learning models to emulate human agents:</p><p name="873a" id="873a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(1) a real number to real number bijection that contains enough information to describe real world processes that we have no access to directly but we are forced to deal with using the discrete structures and tools we have access to using cognition, thought, and language;</p><p name="eade" id="eade" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(2) a real number to integer bijection for perception to map a continuous noisy set of real inputs to primitive sense-percepts able to be discretely referenced in thoughts as particular objects, with linguistically-expressible mental states able to be encoded as unique integers via Godel encoding or simply rendering thought into any computational formalism and turning that computational state into a unique integer intimately linked to that sequence of n zeros and ones in binary;</p><p name="94b1" id="94b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(3) an integer to integer bijection for thought attempting to approach correspondence to reality like an asymptotic limit, whether through the functional programming/lambda calculus formalism for dialectical thinking or the object-oriented programming/Turing machine formalism for metaphysical thinking, because of that homology between thoughts and computational states demonstrated by EngLISP as a bridge plus the fact that all computational models can be distilled down to a particular way to make bijections where the domain and the range are both integers; and</p><p name="4e4d" id="4e4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(4) an integer to real number bijection for agent-based action which takes a discrete executed decision translated to action and maps it to a probabilistic fuzzy set of real consequences for the underlying real world processes whose state representation we take as a bijection between the real numbers;</p><p name="44fa" id="44fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">… with all of agent-like behavior being reducible to one or more parts of this perpetual 4-movement loop for agents, whether human or AI.</p><p name="f3fd" id="f3fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I use integer to integer bijection as thought, as the shared “language” of many united computational processes, the integer approximation of a continuous reality, each integer denoting a computational state and thus mapping out all computable models and thus human cognitive and linguistic models since language is discrete too and enumerable.</p><p name="0390" id="0390" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone goes through the Universal Loop whether they like it or know it or not, but materialists stress the real number to real number bijection over the integer to integer bijection, seeing the latter as the approximation corresponding to the former which has greater ontological status, while idealists see the bijection over the integers to hold the Platonic ideal form which the real world noisily fuzzily approximates using its bijection over the real numbers. Hence, materialism versus idealism in philosophy actually boils down to whether the real number class is seen as ontologically primary over the integer class or vice-versa, and to degrees, not a binary opposition.</p><p name="4f06" id="4f06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Hence, I show how to descend step-by-step from EngLISP down to this ultimate origin point in formalism involving the 4 possible bijections between integer/real numbers in any pairing as the domain and range. EngLISP flips the MinimaLIST general method from philosophically qualitative to formally quantitative due to the rigor of its underlying subject-matter. It shows convincingly how to reduce human natural language into computational models discretely, and then the rest of my “descent down to the formal-scientific MinimaLIST ground floor” follows.</p></div></div></section><section name="d5ba" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="877e" id="877e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Second in priority would be a critique of neoclassical economics using the same general method I am applying everywhere else, but I won’t feel comfortable giving it until after I finish reading and understanding Capital Volumes I-IV and college intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics textbooks, which will be my primary textual basis for this question, in my own leisure time outside of my high-workload Masters program, to achieve a certain high bar of confidence in the originality and impact of my critical analysis.</p><p name="698d" id="698d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I already have quite a few rough notes on high-level logical structure and specific arguments, most of it being original (but the rest were me inadvertently stumbling upon the same point of critique that was already found in the academic literature), yet that approach would be fragmentary, arbitrary, and unacceptable to publish.</p><p name="d93e" id="d93e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, I want a systematic, exhaustive, and integrated treatment of the subject within its own immanent logic and against both the empirical facts and its comparator schools of economics.

It is a target I realized empirically, not just justified a priori.</p><p name="7eb5" id="7eb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Virtually the entire project was thought out “aloud” via ChatGPT and if there is any public interest in the far future, I can release my voluminous raw unedited ChatGPT chat logs over many months to show the process through which I arrived at these novel conceptions.</p></div></div></section><section name="a599" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="9cd1" id="9cd1" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The MinimaLIST idea and the “MinimaLIST” neologism are the fruits of my own personal reflection upon unspoken heuristics that I had been unconsciously applying to my own projects for a long time, but I admit that it is fairly general and not truly unique besides me extracting them from looking at my own patterns and giving them a catchy name.</p><p name="adb6" id="adb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tradeoffs between two or more metrics that cannot all brought to optimum, or even approach being zero-sum, are found in every scientific and engineering field. The classical “guns and butter” and comparative advantage fairy tales in neoclassical economics are good examples, not to mention the contributions of Pareto to the field of efficiently allocating scarce resources.</p><p name="7143" id="7143" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Software engineering has 5 C’s of heuristics for enterprise developers, including “cohesion” and “completeness”, which elegantly map onto minimalism and sufficiency, because the former means excluding within a class everything other than the core task, i.e., that which is “noisy” or “redundant”, while the latter means that a class must support every responsibility and use-case that the developer promised that it would satisfy. Hence, all I can say is that I chose to bundle these 2 C’s out of the conventional 5 C’s, make them directly tradeoff with each other, gave them a catchy name, and universalized this design criterion for every Concrete topic domain.</p><p name="cd78" id="cd78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of trying to dig through software engineering manuals to encounter these ideas, I give it a clear and simple expression as a “MinimaLIST”, initially in commonsensical intuitive English prose when not deployed to a specific topic scope. For each of my 4 academic domains, I present how I made this universal generality specific to their Concrete particular subject-matter, as I said earlier concerning the MinimaLIST method taking up different manifestations in different concrete practices.</p><p name="6541" id="6541" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">For instance, the MinimaLIST approach to the formal sciences digs into the formal substrate that the qualitative gloss of the generalized casual formulation of the MinimaLIST heuristic (when it is not yet specific to any topic scopes) conceals as it compels its applicant to ground it and apply it within a formal computational-mathematical foundation. This makes the MinimaLIST method look more or less rigorous and difficult depending on which subject it is applied to. The MinimaLIST approach to Life Organization, for instance, can dispense with this formal science scaffolding and apply in a transparent casual way what is meant by minimalism, sufficiency, and abstractions using day-to-day words and commonsensical logic as its standard of proof. It thus contextually absorbs the idiomatic register and substance of whichever particular concrete field it is applied to.</p></div></div></section><section name="1946" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f555" id="f555" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Now for some futureproofing.</p><blockquote name="1a5c" id="1a5c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Nota Bene for Provenance:</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em"> </em>The <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">EngLISP</em></strong> idea and this “<strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">EngLISP</em></strong>” neologism, neither of which appeared on the Internet until I published this Medium article, is <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">wholly my own intellectual creation and I did not have any collaborators or rely upon any other scholar’s work to synthesize it</em></strong>, although many of its components, including the English natural language, the Lisp programming language family, and the concept of an intermediate language in between natural languages and programming languages have existed for a long time. <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">I did not employ any university resources</em></strong>, neither any I have attended nor any others, to produce this idea, neither was I enrolled in any academic institution on the date of its creation.</blockquote><p name="5cbf" id="5cbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Unlike the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">MinimaLIST</strong> method, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">EngLISP</strong> is specific and unique enough as a novel theoretical entity to be justly coupled solely to my own name, especially with such a catchy name.</p><p name="b0bf" id="b0bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I estimate that I came up with the idea of representing English prose in a Lisp-like format 5–10 years ago as a casual toy idea, but the idea of using it as a canonical syntactically-regularized universal intermediate language, able to be read easily by most English readers with just a tiny manual on Lisp S-expression nested parentheses syntax, yet also able to be compiled as a Lisp program using its built-in metaprogramming features as a natural extension of Lisp’s expressiveness as a programming language, and specifically for the purpose of enabling LLMs, while preserving the same architecture, to trace patterns within and optimize semantic content instead of incurring hallucinations through tracing patterns within and optimizing surface-level syntactic patterns, dates to 01 August 2025.</p><p name="d576" id="d576" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I chose to publicize EngLISP first out of many novel ideas that I have produced not because it comes first genealogically or conceptually, or because I expect it to be the most popular or because it is my favorite but because it is cynically the most potentially monetizable (socially useful), so I wanted to ensure that it is publicly obvious on the Internet that I am the sole original source with a timestamp before anyone else claims this idea.</p></div></div></section><section name="6baa" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d864" id="d864" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Unless this Medium account blows up, I am cautious of providing anymore detailed private information, but you can probably find my contact information somewhere on my Medium profile.

I am not claiming that they will become lucrative but I am just hedging the possibility that what should be a great day for me will become the opposite due to rent-seekers.
