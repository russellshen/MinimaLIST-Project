# Appendix – Archived Medium Articles (and in the future, ChatGPT Chat Logs)

This folder contains verbatim copies of my original Medium writings.
They are preserved primarily for **timestamping**, **IP provenance**, and **historical documentation**.

- [2025-08-31 – A Semantic Proposal to Break the Syntactic Ceiling](./2025-08-31-semantic-proposal.html)
- [2025-09-11 – Basic Introduction: Who I Am and What I Do](./2025-09-11-basic-introduction.html)
- [2025-10-14 – Heads up on MinimaLIST Project Rebasing](./2025-10-14-heads-up.html)

In the future, I may also add my ChatGPT chat logs in this folder since all
of my "laboratory notebook work" is consolidated on there. The same reasons
for preservation also apply. I have not yet decided whether to redact
sensitive personal ChatGPT conversations or not, since it balances
intellectual honesty with privacy.

These are **not** the living version of the MinimaLIST or EngLISP ideas.  
The evolving canonical modules are under [`/modules`](./modules).
