# Appendix – Archived Medium Articles (and in the future, ChatGPT Chat Logs)

This folder contains verbatim copies of my original Medium writings.
They are preserved primarily for **timestamping**, **IP provenance**, and **historical documentation**.

- [2025-09-11 – Basic Introduction: Who I Am and What I Do](./2025-09-11-basic-introduction.html)
- [2025-10-14 – Heads up on MinimaLIST Project Rebasing](./2025-10-14-heads-up.html)

Please download the .html file and open it in your browser, because GitHub
does not render .html files as the intended webpage but instead as the raw
HTML/CSS markup language.

Additionally, I added 2 essays I wrote in June 2025 which predate the
MinimaLIST project but are a good window to my conception and misconception
of Marxist theory at that time. I have a more sophisticated understanding
of the law of value and the transformation problem archived in my ChatGPT
chat logs garnered through reading Capital and introspection, which are
still not released.

That being said, in the future, I may also add my ChatGPT chat logs in this
folder since all of my "laboratory notebook work" is consolidated on there.
The same reasons for preservation also apply. I have not yet decided whether
to redact sensitive personal ChatGPT conversations or not, since that balances
intellectual honesty with privacy.

These are **not** the living version of the MinimaLIST or EngLISP ideas.  
The evolving canonical modules are under [`/modules`](../modules).
