# Appendix – Archived Medium Articles and Unpublished Essays (and in the future, ChatGPT Chat Logs) [README.md]

This folder contains verbatim copies of my original Medium writings.
They are preserved primarily for **timestamping**, **IP provenance**, and
**historical documentation**.

- [2025-09-11 – Basic Introduction: Who I Am and What I Do](./2025-09-11-basic-introduction.html)
- [2025-10-14 – Heads up on MinimaLIST Project Rebasing](./2025-10-14-heads-up.html)

does not render .html files as the intended webpage but instead as the raw
HTML/CSS markup language.

I forgot to name-drop the **Curry-Howard correspondence** in the Basic
Introduction Medium article but it essentially produces an isomorphism
between proofs and algorithms, which helps substantiate the computational
formal infrastructure propping up EngLISP, because EngLISP acts as an
interface between natural language text which when rigorous becomes like
a proof, and that proof has a one-to-one correspondence with a computer
program, i.e., Lisp in this case. The Curry-Howard correspondence hence
bolsters and justifies my intermediate language representation by providing
some theoretical guarantees of this one-to-one mapping between idealized
natural language and computational programs.

I also forgot to mention placing creativity and divergent thinking under
the column for dialectical reasoning, and rigor and convergent thinking
under the column for metaphysical reasoning. The aim is to show how
all these computational formal concepts and cognitive scientific mappings
of human thought fall into one of these 2 buckets that neatly map onto
the dialectics/metaphysics division in philosophy. This grounds that
perennial problem in philosophy on top of a rigorous formalism. This
is referring to the "3rd Floor" section of the experimental part of the
Basic Introduction Medium article where I descend from EngLISP down the
chain of formal sciences until it hits rock bottom in the foundational
model I explain as the 1st (Ground) Floor. EngLISP represents only the
fourth floor, a fourth-order birds-eye-view introduction to my formalized
"stack" that descends 4 stories to the Ground Floor while being compelled
by the drive to ground EngLISP in the simplest and most universal
axiomatic model possible. You could even consider the MinimaLIST method
for the formal sciences to be the 5th floor, a still qualitative and casual
level of analysis that takes on its quantitative and rigorous form when
it starts probing these difficult complexities of natural language
processing. EngLISP is the entry point for the portion of my project
concerned about the formal sciences because it is the most accessible
layer for pedagogical reasons and for pragmatic reasons due to the recent
hype concerning LLMs, not because it is the "deepest layer", which it is
not.

Yet I cannot change the archived articles anymore, so here I am name-dropping
these additions that I wish I had incorporated prior to freezing my Medium
profile.

Additionally, I added 2 essays I wrote in June 2025 which predate the
MinimaLIST project but are a good window to my conception and misconception
of Marxist theory at that time. I have a more sophisticated understanding
of the law of value and the transformation problem archived in my ChatGPT
chat logs garnered through reading Capital and introspection, which are
still not released.

- [2025-06-10 - The Law of Value in Karl Marx's Capital](./2025-06-10-law-of-value-karl-marx-capital.md)

That being said, in the future, I may also add my ChatGPT chat logs in this
folder since all of my "laboratory notebook work" is consolidated on there.
The same reasons for preservation also apply. I have not yet decided whether
to redact sensitive personal ChatGPT conversations or not, since that balances
intellectual honesty with privacy.

These are **not** the living version of the MinimaLIST or EngLISP ideas.  
The evolving canonical modules are under [`/modules`](../modules).
