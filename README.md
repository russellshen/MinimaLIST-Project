# MinimaLIST-Project
The MinimaLIST Approach to Life and Understanding Reality: Once a book project but now a series of interlinked article-modules to explain
the MinimaLIST approach and then apply it to 4 concrete domains in which I am experienced and uncover truths that were infeasible or
impossible to access before applying the MinimaLIST method to them.

## Appendix
Archived Medium articles (and in the future, ChatGPT chat logs) can be found in the [`/appendix`](./appendix) folder for the sake of documentation.
