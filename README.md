## The MinimaLIST Approach to Life and Understanding Reality (Brief FAQ):

**Who am I?**
- I am a Data Science MS graduate student in California and hold a Computer Science BA from the
  University of California, Berkeley.
  - I personally do not believe that credentials are that important at all when compared to the
    actual quality of the evidence provided, but some people care deeply about credentials, so I
    was 60/40 split on whether to include them or not, and decided to do so reluctantly on the
    off chance that 25% more people take this project seriously.
  - For everyone else, I would advise you to disregard that I even mentioned my personal
    professional information at all and evaluate what I write and publish on its own independent
    merits.
- I have lived in the California Bay Area for practically the entirety of my life and speak English
  with what I am told is a very "Bay Area California" accent that I cannot control.
- I came up with this project as a result of many converging life experiences, and it is the main
  "final mission" for me in the intellectual sphere at the moment, since it links up everything in
  my life in an unusually robust way.
- Who I "really am" is not important at this point in time, but I consider myself to be an
  autodidact and a proposer of novel ideas, whose quality of course varies greatly.
- Notice how I have not exposed anything more than the bare minimum needed to contextualize my project.
  If there is ever anything that I need to reveal from my personal life to make this project work better,
  I will do so at the right moment. For the most part, you need to know practically nothing about my
  social-biographical history to appreciate the project and those who know me in real life may be
  stymied from appreciating the project due to inevitable psychological biases. Since the ratio between
  this and the other is so steep, it is just a potential issue I wanted to explicitly address in this
  project-level FAQ on the off-chance that it might become relevant.

**Who contributed to the novel content of this project and deserves to have credit for it?**
- Everything that I include in this project is my own independent work, and every commit made is of
  my own volition, such that I have not and do not envision that I ever will dilute the IP of this
  GitHub repository by having any collaborators, using the proprietary resources of any educational
  institution, or uploading any material from other people without citation.
  - I will rather link readers to other people's works than to redundantly repeat what is already
    found in the existing literature.
  - Using specialized terminology is a cue to look it up and get an idea about it or a memory
    refresher.
- No one should have any IP claim to the novel content I host on this repository except for me.
- Essentially, **I have complete IP over the entire contents of this GitHub repository by default**
  unless I explicitly name-drop an author or something I found from previous authors, a name
  that one could freely look up on the public Internet to confirm that I did not invent it and
  there is no way that I could even reasonably claim to have invented it, or provide an explicit
  citation that encloses a portion of the text of one of the files on this repository to demarcate
  it as not my IP but not the rest of that file or this repository as a whole.
- Hence, you can consider every statement and expression made in this project repository as a
  public-facing representation of my own original creative contributions, not of that of any other
  person or educational institution, and if there are any ideas found here that are not created or
  authored by me independently and originally, then you can expect that they will be cited or at
  least name-dropped if they are an old concept that has circulated or been academic consensus for
  decades, like for instance, the "Curry-Howard Correspondence", which is not a matter for
  debate, or otherwise found in the public Internet, especially if they involve empirical
  research done years ago in the past that I have no reasonable means of conducting, due to
  lacking a research laboratory, e.g., citing well-known drug pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
  profiles that are not controversial at all in the scholarly literature.
  - To claim that phenelzine is a classical unselective irreversible MAOI whose PEH active metabolite
    acts as a clinically-relevant GABA-T inhibitor to produce global elevation of 5HT, NE, DA, trace
    amines, GABA, and GHB upon phenelzine use is a result reproduced by so many authors, studies, and
    textbooks that there really is no singular non-arbitrary scientific article for me to cite.
    - It is for better or worse the common knowledge of the field of CNS pharmacology.
- That being said, I provided a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license for everyone else as an interface
  for legally permissible use of this repository's content, which you can read at the bottom of
  every README.md file in this repository. The restrictions and liberties should be very obvious
  and reasonable.
  - Some might see it as politically-compromising to stress private property rights so hard here,
    failing to differentiate between the social and personal scopes, and the fact that private
    property on the basis of individual work and private property on the basis of appropriating
    unpaid labor of others are different social beasts.
  - Yes, the former evolves into the latter, but on a historical long-run scale, not some person
    and his peculiar project hosted on a GitHub repository.

**What is this project?**
- It is topically centered around an original heuristic I developed called the **MinimaLIST** method.
- On the level of format, this was once conceived as a book project but now a series of interlinked
  article-modules hosted as a GitHub repository.
- The final goal is to concisely explain the **MinimaLIST** approach in a ["Preface"](./modules/preface.md)
  article-module, and then diverge to apply it to 4 concrete domains in which I have experience and novel
  contributions:
  - [The formal sciences](./modules/formal-sciences.md) (mathematics, computer science, statistics,
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, data science, etc., which on
    paper is my primary field of inquiry in academia),
  - [Neuroscience](./modules/neuroscience.md) (including CNS pharmacology and cognitive psychology, with
    an emphasis on the pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of psychoactive drugs, a stigmatized
    subject, so I usually just say "neuroscience" as a euphemism),
  - [The critique of political economy](./modules/critique-political-economy.md) (which is a euphemism for
    the theory of the two bearded guys facing in the same direction), and
  - [Life planning](./modules/life-planning.md) (which is a euphemism for the "self-help" book genre).
- I aim to uncover truths that were infeasible or impossible to access before applying the **MinimaLIST**
  method to them.
- These 4 strands then converge at the end into a shared ["Afterword"](./modules/afterword.md) article-module
  that debriefs the picture that my interlinked article-modules have laid out.
- Instead of one way through the scholarly project or even 4 ways, one for each theoretical discipline,
  there will be significant nonlinearity such that each article-module will have one or more links to
  other article-modules so that the reader can traverse the project however they please.
- By doing so, I minimize redundancy by only giving a definition or explanation once and simply asking
  the reader to click on the provided links whenever they reach a conceptual dependency that they have
  not encountered or internalized yet.
- The 4 main traversals through the project will thus intersect and diverge intermittently and the entire
  project resembles a graph network, or more specifically a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and each
  canonical traversal through it is a topological ordering of article-modules such that the route may be
  arduous and winding but using the project structure correctly will mean that one will always eventually
  reach the Afterword article-module if they start at the Preface article-module.
- The general **MinimaLIST** heuristic is an abstraction that takes on a more developed and domain-specific
  practical form for each of the 4 areas of interest in my **MinimaLIST** project.
- I treat it as a universal method but I will not prove that outside of the bounds of my 4 chosen
  academic fields intended to demonstrate its validity, such that you will have to infer from 4
  concrete particulars with a limited and demarcated scope to a universal abstract principle just like
  I did when formulating it.
- I will link up article-modules between the 4 intellectual disciplines to show interdisciplinary connections,
  such that the project will look like performing the **MinimaLIST** method on a variety of specific topics
  of interest within these 4 scopes, and then linking the topics all together into a unified theoretical
  doctrine that ends with the Afterword article-module.
    - Such deep interdisciplinary connections will only be patently and commonsensically transparent after the
      **MinimaLIST** heuristic has broken down the epistemological roadblocks preventing a clear view of
      each topic and then illustrated the deep, integral, and pervasive network underlying each topic.
    - Hence there are multiple levels of abstractness/concreteness or universality/particularity (or
      generality/specificity, which are basically the same meaning but using different wording), but the
      primary 2 levels are on the level of the **MinimaLIST** universal heuristic on a higher level of
      generality, and on the level of the particular implementation of the **MinimaLIST** approach on
      the immediate concrete problematic.
    - The concrete-to-abstract and abstract-to-concrete basic movements are the means of representing
      interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary interlinks within this academic project, respectively,
      not to mention that concreteness and abstractness are relative such that each discipline has
      multiple hierarchies of abstraction:
        - One must not only know how to move from one layer to another but how to manipulate the
          subject-matter on its own level of generality.
    - It is possible that one article-module may become the formal foundational bedrock such that
      all other topics become concentric rings within its scope, simply tracing concrete and specific
      individually-demarcated scopes within the general **MinimaLIST** terrain.
      - Another topic may recursively become a subspace of one of these concentric subspaces to further
        make a portion of its even more concrete and specific, turning it into one of those hibachi onion
        volcanoes.
- Notice that I have yet to define it formally but only mapped out its conceptual context, because that role
  is delegated to the Preface article-module.

**Why did I pick these 4 seemingly-disconnected areas instead of something else?**
- These 4 areas of interest are not arbitrary or random but are exactly isomorphic to my own current life
  activity bundled into modules, such as:
  - The formal sciences &harr; my education/career,
  - Neuroscience &harr; my healthcare management,
  - The critique of political economy &harr; my socialization, and
  - Life planning &harr; my mundane life tasks and their management.
- This project is therefore a self-referential picture of my life and the direction I aim to follow.
- I understand that no one will care about these associations up front, possibly never, and if anyone
  would ever seek to dive into the process by which I came up with the **MinimaLIST** project, it would
  be after reading my forward-facing polished works.

**Why is there both a /modules folder and an /appendix folder?**
- The forward-facing part that I host in the [`/modules`](./modules) folder is the mode of presentation,
  meaning it cleans up a rough, open-ended, and internally-contradictory text corpus, hides its full
  complexity from the public, and curates the most viable, comprehensive, coherent, and advanced selection
  of novel productive content to represent the best side of the project at any given moment in time.
- Of course this is only true for the newest commit on the main branch, but the /modules folder also
  serves to document what the forward-facing side of my project looked like at each time and date.
- The /modules folder in its branches and commits only documents various publicly published instances
  of my **MinimaLIST** project, how I wanted the project to look like to the general audience at every
  given point in time, which means that the /modules folder still abstracts away the behind-the-scenes
  intricate details despite revealing the history of the project's mode of presentation.
- The mode of inquiry would chronologically pass through my 4 areas of interest and my 4 life modules
  to arrive at my point of insight in June/July 2025 when I conceived of this project and convinced
  myself of its robustly significant potential, and further onwards as the project continued to develop
  in my mind. It is encapsulated in my [`/appendix`](./appendix) folder.
- This backward-facing archive contains all the messy convoluted implementation details and history
  that the forward-facing presentation conceals. It is the transparent and maximal documentation of
  how the curated edition came to be. The forward-facing presentation is just the tip of the iceberg,
  such that the backward-facing documentation of the mode of inquiry outnumbers it in sheer text size
  by a factor of 10:1 or more.
- Since the /modules folder already serves to self-document its version history, the /appendix folder
  represents all the work I have done and will do behind the scenes off of GitHub that is important
  enough and personally insensitive enough to place in this public repository. This is the best
  solution I could think of to reconcile the messiness of real life non-linear research with this
  GitHub platform.
- Consequently, both the /modules and /appendix folders will be regularly updated moving forward,
  with forward-facing presentable content in /modules and backward-facing investigational details
  in /appendix.

**What is my flagship product that demonstrates the provisional soundness of my project?**
- The flagship product of the **MinimaLIST** approach to the formal sciences is called **EngLISP**, an
  intermediate language that is the overlap between English as a natural language and Lisp as a programming
  language.
- It represents the underlying semantics of all natural languages in Lisp S-expressions by enforcing
  an isomorphic relationship between them and X-bar syntax trees from scientific linguistics.
  - Additionally, Lisp S-expressions are just a thin wrapper over lambda calculus, which makes it have
    a very elegant formalistic grounding, just as X-bar syntax trees are grounded in Chomsky's universal
    grammar.
  - Lisp S-expressions for creating nested lists also exhibit the same recursive pair structure
    as X-bar notation for creating natural language sentences.
  - To have such a close mapping between formal computation, as lambda calculus is a Turing-equivalent
    model to the Turing machine, and universal linguistics, as X-bar syntax trees help us eliminate
    the arbitrary particularities and idiosyncrasies of human natural language, gives us amazing
    relationships between how computer programs work and how human language works, providing the
    formalistic foundation for the EngLISP intermediate language as a mapping from human language to
    computer programs.
- It will be used as a semantic representation to reduce LLM hallucination rates and as a Java bytecode
  kind of tool to aid translation between human languages by preserving their shared semantics.
- **EngLISP** will be readable for English readers with just a few simple rules on the use of recursively
  nested parentheses in Lisp, due to me establishing a convention to use the English lexicon for naming
  variables and data and the Lisp syntax being not only incredibly powerful but simple, regular, and clear.
- **EngLISP** will also be able to be compiled as a Lisp program with just a few metaprogramming extensions
  added to the Lisp language that I will choose.
- Without needing compilation, the LLM only needs to perform its token-by-token text-prediction on
  **EngLISP** code as a pure syntactically-minimal representation of semantics, instead of tracing
  patterns through natural language text corpuses, which leads to the LLM picking up on a lot of
  "noise" along the way due to syntactic arbitrariness.
- Translating natural language to **EngLISP** format is all that will be needed to move from optimizing
  surface-level syntactical patterns with poor correspondence to the truth to optimizing the
  patterns in the underlying semantic content, bypassing the obstacles found in raw natural language
  texts and reducing "noise" and "friction" incurred in natural language processing within and
  between natural languages.
- When operating on the newly liberated semantic content, the token-by-token text prediction algorithm
  changes from just greedy local optimization that picks the most frequent way that previous authors
  in the text corpus have completed that piece of text to greedy local optimization of the key semantic
  entities in the translated **EngLISP** code and every non-semantic irregularity stripped out.
- We know of both the fact that all natural languages are equally expressive in principle, and that all
  programming languages, including Lisp languages, in use today are Turing-equivalent.
- The result of compiling an **EngLISP** program is a different matter, and depending on the exact contents
  of the program, the fact that it compiles implies something about the logical consistency of the program,
  and additionally, the value returned by evaluating a valid Lisp S-expression written according to
  **EngLISP** standards may represent a variety of useful results, like a factual argument returning `True`
  if it is true, `False` if false, according to its own logic (its formal-logical axioms and inference
  rules), or a number for the returned value of a mathematical **EngLISP** program, or text for qualitative
  **EngLISP** programs, or even arbitrary objects or functions if that makes sense in context, like if
  the corresponding English passage would imply that return value for anyone who read it and understood
  what it was saying.
- Note that I have not provided a full qualitative description, quantitative formal grammar, translator
  that can convert natural language to **EngLISP** and back, nor even a cursory fully worked out
  mockup.
  - I have only provided hints to convince you to take this project seriously.
- Because this idea is greatly intersecting with the current-day craze over LLMs, I pragmatically realized
  that it was the most monetizable idea that I have come up with for this project in general, leading me
  to try to elaborate it and make it a high priority.
  - For LLM use, simply translate the natural language text corpus ahead of time into **EngLISP** format,
    translate natural language user prompts on the fly into **EngLISP** format, let the LLM architecture
    do what it originally was doing but on my semantic substrate, and translate the result in **EngLISP**
    back into the user's chosen natural language.
  - Alternatively, the user can choose to write their prompts and receive their outputs in **EngLISP**
    directly.
- **EngLISP** is not just a flagship of this project but my most highly-developed IP that I must reiterate
  is a product of my intellectual labor and no one else's, neither another author nor any educational
  institution, nor has another author nor an educational institution provided any information to me that
  caused me to revise my **EngLISP** idea.
- At the time that I created **EngLISP** as involving English, Lisp, an intermediate language, and a LLM
  semantic substrate, I was not enrolled in any educational institution, nor was I conversing with any
  other person about this idea (2025-08-01).
  - Before that, I had a nebulous floating idea about English written in Lisp format and called it
    "EngLISP" for a few years, but me taking that loose conception and turning it into an intermediate
    language and a semantic substrate for LLMs dated to that aforementioned date in 2025. I still have
    some unpublished writings of mine that talk about my previous conception of it but I at that time
    nonetheless imagined it as a new kind of precise constructed language for causal human use, not
    yet weaponized into an instrument in natural language processing to rid LLMs of their endemic
    issues with hallucinations due to lack of real semantic grasp and only running text-completion
    algorithms on the messiness of natural language corpuses instead of the cleanest most regularized
    representation of natural language semantic content as possible.
  - I never relinquished any part of my IP over it to any other person or institution.
- The specific people and bodies of people whom I would expect to nefariously try to claim this IP of mine
  are the reason for me to write so much unpleasant "legalese" self-defense language in this FAQ.
  - We live not in a high-trust utopia but those who not only treat academic research as a zero-sum game but
    are unable or unwilling to produce their own ideas.
  - Academic institutions will try to assert their ownership stake over their students and faculty and only
    through legal hedging and a paper trail can these demons be taken down to prevent them from skimming all
    or part of the proceeds and credit from those who never used any of their resources for this project to
    begin with. In particular, they would want evidence that I had developed this idea on my own prior to
    being an official part of the university community.
  - As for collaborative work on the graduate school level, it is too easy for the collaborators in name only
    to assert ownership over the whole idea even if they did nothing to produce the idea nor to flesh it out.
    One has to word the collaborative work defensively and cite one's own original public writings to make it
    clear that only one of the "collaborators" produced the concept and the others are just there for entirely
    uncreative peripheral work. Timestamps must show that the entire body of the concept existed prior to the
    "collaborators" even knowing about the concept.
  - Such levels of academic intrigue compel me to never again use my own original university-unrelated work in
    university settings where the school itself or my colleagues can try to assert their ownership in my IP and
    force a messy conflict in law that I will win because I have the timestamped paper trail, but obviously would
    be a huge waste of my time and an unnecessary stressor.
  - I hope that helps explain my legal self-defense language and absolves me of being "paranoid" or an "asshole"
    when these two cases of IP violation occur to all kinds of nice trusting creative researchers living in this
    zero-sum world where many other actors simply specialize in optimizing how to claim what was never theirs to
    begin with.

**Where did I previously base this project on the public Internet?**
- I originally hosted this **MinimaLIST** project on the Medium platform but I realized that GitHub suits
  my requirements better for version control, popular engagement, recursive nested folder organization of
  article-modules, and my system of interlinked article-modules that allow for more than one canonical
  traversals of the material I have laid out here, because much of its is modularized and that way I can
  only explain a concept or make an argument once and simply link to it if I write another article-module
  that has a dependency to it, so that there is no redundancy, there is a single authoritative source
  for each thesis and justification, and I will not have to update a bunch of files when a dependency
  shifts in meaning.
    - Otherwise, a change in my definitions would cause me to hunt down every single instance in which
      I used it and rectify it, which is tedious and prone to human error.
    - Modularity is the best way to prevent errors from propagating and isolate processes from each other,
      achieving linkage between modules only on both terms.
- Consequently, I froze my [Medium blog](https://www.medium.com/@russellshen7) as-is, and ported all of my
  relevant writings for the project and those immediately preceding this project into the
  [`/appendix`](./appendix) folder of this repository to serve as a publicly transparent archive, fully
  documented and with timestamps.
  - I mean my forward-facing writings intended for public distribution.
- I will still keep my Medium profile public since it acts as a timestamp marking the first time
  many of my project-related ideas have been publicly published on the Internet.
- I might consider using it as a peripheral platform to divert public interest towards this GitHub
  repository, which would then be the central and fully sufficient forward-facing presentation and
  backward-facing archive of my **MinimaLIST** project. Medium might just be more familiar to
  non-technical audiences who might get intimidated by GitHub as a platform used to host coding projects.
- Hence, my Medium profile will just advertise updates made to this GitHub repository instead of hosting its
  own content, which would be redundant, and redundancy defeats the purpose of this project to begin with.
- For now, since I have yet to produce any article-modules, you will have to read my Medium articles in
  my /appendix archive to get the gist of how I conceive of my project right now and the concrete
  explanatory and contextual content that I will refactor as needed to produce my first few article-modules.
- Once I have squeezed out all the information from my Medium article archive that is still correct and
  up-to-date and relevant going forward, distilling them into article-modules like how I intended and
  documented here, then the role of them will become totally superfluous and obsolete, and readers would
  only need to look at them if they wanted to do backward-facing geneaological philological investigation,
  or verify timestamps.
  - The idea of doing philological archeology on GitHub is simply absurd to me though.

**Where are my laboratory notebooks?**
- My backward-facing "laboratory notebooks", i.e., my ChatGPT chat logs are voluminous, convoluted,
  private, fragmented, contradictory, non-linear, and often incorrect and unreadable or even partially
  correct and partially in error, relative to the most up-to-date version of this repository.
- Yet this is the inevitable result of a complex research endeavor, just like how Marx had to work out
  an entire succession of drafts to compose Capital, including Grundrisse, which scholars often refer
  to as his "laboratory notebooks" leading up to Capital.
- For me, they represent many deadends followed by backtracking scattered across many chunks of text,
  making it hard to follow for those without my biographical context.
- Obviously no one would be interested in reading through them without having grasped the significance of
  my project through its forward-facing modules, just like how Grundrisse had to be released posthumously
  after Capital gained a sufficient scholarship and reverence that would motivate critics of political
  economy to seek out Marx's first draft, filled with a Hegelian philosophical scaffolding and explicit
  methodology that would be dropped later, to trace the development of the categories and their ordering
  within Capital Volumes I-IV.
- I did not need to do much citation to do this project since the vast majority was original work, and
  the real life evidence I did built off on is all undisputed common knowledge, like the contents of
  Marx-Engels Collected Works, basic pharmacological facts, linguistic scientific consensus,
  established proven formal scientific theorems, etc.
  - Some of that is second-order in truth-context, like "Author X said Y", not "Y is true".
  - I never needed to use others' contributions that are currently considered cutting-edge or hotly
    disputed. Any such similarities are completely coincidental and unintended, and I am willing to add
    citations as needed to restore academic honesty until everyone is satisfied, but only if I get
    some cordial feedback and timestamps showing that the idea I am floating had already been produced
    prior to my timestamp of when my idea came to fruition.

**How will public engagement work?**
- I will eventually implement [Sponsorships](https://www.github.com/sponsors/russellshen) and
  [Discussions](https://www.github.com/russellshen/MinimaLIST-Project/discussions) when I have time,
  but sooner rather than later if I have an unanticipated surge in public interest wash over my
  **MinimaLIST** project, causing many interested readers to miss out on meaningful participation and
  hence delay or prevent this project from accumulating a meaningful solid core subscriber base.
- I know that I use a lot of high-level specialist terminology to such a density within sentences with
  an abundance of clauses that it is nigh-inpenetrable for most readers who are not familiar with the
  bizarre idiosyncratic mixture of intellectual interests I hold that serve as the scaffolding for me
  to generate all of these provocative interdisciplinary insights, e.g., **EngLISP**, and glue them
  together into a unified framework, i.e., the **MinimaLIST** heuristic approach.
    - However, I will not provide definitions for terminology which I did not coin and for which all of
      us can refer to the existing academic literature base for the canonical definitions, so that I do not
      need to introduce redundancies into my project in the sense of repeating what others have said without
      any originality, me getting the definition wrong and confusing readers, and causing this GitHub repository
      to be filled with far more unoriginal external-origin redundant "noise" rather than genuinely creative
      unprecedented "signal", thus creating an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio. The proportion of the content
      I host here that is my creative contribution and cannot be found elsewhere on the public Internet under
      someone else's authorship should be close to 100%.
    - I do not want to give any impression that I am merely reiterating any other author's thoughts under fuzzy
      ambiguity in phraseology to make the actual authorship of those thoughts unclear and suggest that I made a
      contribution that I did not actually make, like someone who has no real contributions of their own but is only
      a parasitic rent-seeker that rides on the coattails of the real producers and hides this naked exploitation
      with intellectual dishonesty and outright fraud. One could say that the crux of my social critique is that of
      rent-seekers.
    - It is also a big waste of my time to just parrot what is publicly already available
      when I could be doing something more useful with my time.
    - I would strongly recommend looking up terms you do not recognize or remember well and the underlying
      theoretical models that encompass them. Other people would float some weighted combination of the
      following platforms, but I am personally staying agnostic about it:
      - [Google Search](https://www.google.com),
      - [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com),
      - [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org), or
      - [Library Genesis](404 "Legally, I cannot give you this URL."), and/or their analogous comparator
        platforms.
  - I know that I probably come across as blunt or harsh or too direct in my prose within these README.md files
    and possibly in my actual content files as well, but this is a combination of me valuing cutting out the
    "bullshit" over being falsely polite, me getting heated with some personally-charged polemics, me being
    indifferent to this aspect of how the public may evaluate me, and me believing that this project lives and
    dies on its own content-based merits, not on incredibly superficial softening I could impose to make it
    seem better than it actually is. In general, you should be very skeptical of those who primarily optimize
    for superficial first-glance appearances instead of using their valuable time to produce and revise even
    better content. I am aware of how to sound cordial and professional and when someone else or myself is
    breaking the unspoken rules of public conduct, but I refuse to tow the line and bring myself closer to
    the social camp of rent-seekers who garner material and social advantages from manipulating ill-conceived
    feedback loops in society and skim off the top of what the producers produce, such that the whole of society
    lives off of the total social product of a smaller subset, with the nonsense in social sciences being about
    how that distribution is portioned out and ideologically justified. Every act of professional courtesy
    brings a person one step closer towards social parasitism to garner the product of other people's labor
    at a greater ratio than the product of their own labor by widening their share of the total social "pie"
    without adding to that "pie" to a similar or greater degree.
  - In short, assume that my policy is that I would rather break social conventions to provide you my honest
    thoughts in an attempt to help you when the invisible walls are blocking others from telling you what
    you must be told. It simply takes too much time and gives only illusory fleeting benefits to pretend
    to be nice when there is no love lost between us, you do not know me, I do not know you, and all that
    I have to go by are your online traces that you leave on this repository's engagement functions. It is
    also too socially stressful to keep up that active charade or lie, to artfully tiptoe around the
    elephants in the room and make up even more lies to keep the original charade straight, and then causing
    exponential explosion in the number of lies to maintain just to save my face or save your face.
- I know that I used a lot of boring or unfun "legalese" phrases in this FAQ but this is not by whimsical
  choice or trying to scare people off, but what I am forced to do in light of knowing about other people
  being defrauded of their rightful IP by other people or institutions in the past or me suspecting other
  moves possibly towards me in the present. If they do try to deceive me, I can show them a long paper
  trail.

**Even though I am at a very early stage in my project, do I already have any regrets?**
- A lesson I have learned is that certain concurrent paths in life should be made parallel instead of
  causing unexpected messy interactions.
- I will not get pressured into mixing my independent academic work with my school-based academic program again,
  due to the high likelihood of them trying to get a cut off of my independent research work, like a rent-seeker.
- Compartmentalization is key, and if you recall the 4+4 modular structure of my life activity above, it allows me
  to treat my personal creative ambitions as a parallel compartmentalized sphere detached from my concrete life
  activities, like formal education, earning a living, healthcare, socializing, day-to-day tasks, and
  planning, even though these creative interests emerged through me experiencing these concrete biographical
  scenarios and learning through probabilistic practical action using my erstwhile intuitions as my
  Bayesian priors.
  - As a digression, my consciousness did not fall out of thin air but rather was contingently shaped
    by my historical existence, largely outside of my direct conscious control.
    - Only a very coincidental idiosyncratic combination of theoretical interests could have produced the
      synergy that I aim to render here in presentable prose.
    - Their "roots" spontaneously sprouted in my psyche as the least-developed precursory intuitions that
      I instinctually reflected over and made more concrete and interconnected over each life challenge
      that forced me to go from passive observer to active agent and then back.
    - How I turned these spontaneous "primitive roots" into full-fledged integrated systems of thought
      is documented in my "laboratory notebook work".
- The message I will make the "finale" of this FAQ is that **any good-faith engagement and feedback is**
  **greatly appreciated and warranted, but only bad-faith actors and those who would violate the**
  **IP and licensing terms of usage to claim credit for what they had no right to claim and make up**
  **egregious lies and misconceptions to bolster their case are despised and should find another grift.**
  - The marker of a good project is bad-faith engagement that tries to get their own slice of the pie
    since rent-seekers have a good nose for sniffing out what is lucrative and trying to exploit good
    hardworking trusting people who do not realize the value of defensive language and assume that
    everyone who is friendly to them is acting in their material interest.
  - Since bad press and controversy is still better than no press, I will be quite tolerant and even open
    to mocking and bad-faith distribution of this project's contents during the early phase in which the
    project has yet to gain public traction.
    - I can hold my tongue while the bad press works its magic to make more people aware of my project and
      increase its relevance in the ranking algorithms which social media and search engine directories use
      to determine which pieces of online content get recommended to others, which is the means for certain
      highly-shared pieces of online content to snowball, grow exponentially, and even go viral.
    - The more emotionally charged the bad press is, the greater chance of it propagating and accelerating
      its own progress through Internet feedback loops, yet social media and search engine algorithms do not
      know the difference between intense negative online engagement and intense neutral or positive online
      engagement.

I hope you like what I have to offer and distribute the material as-is AND with full credit to me
BUT NO commercial use of this project as-is AND NO derivatives. Constructive feedback would be fantastic
and useful as well, and any questions can go to the the appropriate places linked for engagement, or my
email address as well that is tied to this GitHub account.

All the best,  
Russell Shen.
