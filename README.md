# MinimaLIST-Project
**The MinimaLIST Approach to Life and Understanding Reality:**
- Once a book project but now a series of interlinked article-modules hosted as a GitHub repository.
- The final goal is to concisely explain the MinimaLIST approach and then apply it to 4 concrete domains
in which I am experienced.
- I aim to uncover truths that were infeasible or impossible to access before applying the MinimaLIST
method to them.
- The general MinimaLIST heuristic abstraction takes on a more developed and domain-specific practical
form for each of the 4 areas of interest in my MinimaLIST project.
- I treat it as a universal method but I will not prove that outside of the bounds of my 4 chosen
academic fields intended to demonstrate its validity, such that you will have to infer from 4
concrete particulars with a limited and demarcated scope to a universal abstract principle just like
I did when formulating it.
- My flagship product of the MinimaLIST approach to the formal sciences is called EngLISP, an intermediate
language that is the overlap between English as a natural language and Lisp as a programming language.
- It represents the underlying semantics of all natural languages in Lisp S-expressions by enforcing
an isomorphic relationship between them and X-bar syntax trees from linguistics.
- It will be used as a semantic representation to reduce LLM hallucination rates and as a Java bytecode
kind of tool to aid translation between human languages by preserving their shared semantics.

## Appendix

**Medium:**
- Archived Medium articles (and in the future, ChatGPT chat logs) can be found in the [`/appendix`](./appendix) folder for the sake of documentation.

**Miscellaneous Older Writings:**
- So will many of my pre-MinimaLIST writings be documented and archived under [`/appendix`](./appendix).
