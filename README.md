# MinimaLIST-Project [README.md]

## The MinimaLIST Approach to Life and Understanding Reality (Brief FAQ):

**What is this project?**
- It is topically centered around an original heuristic I developed called the **MinimaLIST** method.
- On the level of format, this was once conceived as a book project but now a series of interlinked
  article-modules hosted as a GitHub repository.
- The final goal is to concisely explain the **MinimaLIST** approach in a "Preface" article-module,
  and then diverge to apply it to 4 concrete domains in which I have experience and novel contributions:
  - The formal sciences,
  - Neuroscience,
  - The critique of political economy, and
  - Life planning.
- I aim to uncover truths that were infeasible or impossible to access before applying the **MinimaLIST**
  method to them.
- These 4 strands then converge at the end into a shared "Afterword" article-module that debriefs the
  picture that my interlinked article-modules have laid out.
- Instead of one way through the scholarly project or even 4 ways, one for each theoretical discipline,
  there will be significant nonlinearity such that each article-module will have one or more links to
  other article-modules so that the reader can traverse the project however they please.
- By doing so, I minimize redundancy by only giving a definition or explanation once and simply asking
  the reader to click on the provided links whenever they reach a conceptual dependency that they have
  not encountered or internalized yet.
- The 4 main traversals through the project will thus intersect and diverge intermittently and the entire
  project resembles a graph network, or more specifically a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and each
  canonical traversal through it is a topological ordering of article-modules such that the route may be
  arduous and winding but using the project structure correctly will mean that one will always eventually
  reach the Afterword article-module if they start at the Preface article-module.
- The general **MinimaLIST** heuristic is an abstraction that takes on a more developed and domain-specific
practical form for each of the 4 areas of interest in my **MinimaLIST** project.
- I treat it as a universal method but I will not prove that outside of the bounds of my 4 chosen
  academic fields intended to demonstrate its validity, such that you will have to infer from 4
  concrete particulars with a limited and demarcated scope to a universal abstract principle just like
  I did when formulating it.
- Notice that I have yet to define it formally but only mapped out its conceptual context, because that role
  is delegated to the Preface article-module.

**Why did I pick these 4 seemingly-disconnected areas instead of something else?**
- These 4 areas of interest are not arbitrary or random but are exactly isomorphic to my own current life
  activity bundled into modules, such as:
  - The formal sciences &harr; my education/career,
  - Neuroscience &harr; my healthcare management,
  - The critique of political economy &harr; my socialization, and
  - Life planning &harr; my mundane life tasks and their management.
- I understand that no one will care about these associations up front, possibly never, and if anyone
  would ever seek to dive into the process by which I came up with the **MinimaLIST** project, it would
  be after reading my forward-facing polished works.

**Why is there both a /modules folder and an /appendix folder?**
- The forward-facing part that I host in the [`/modules`](./modules) folder is the mode of presentation,
  meaning it cleans up a rough, open-ended, and internally-contradictory text corpus, hides its full
  complexity from the public, and curates the most viable, comprehensive, coherent, and advanced selection
  of novel productive content to represent the best side of the project at any given moment in time.
- Of course this is only true for the newest commit on the main branch, but the /modules folder also
  serves to document what the forward-facing side of my project looked like at each time and date.
- The /modules folder in its branches and commits only documents various publicly published instances
  of my **MinimaLIST** project, how I wanted the project to look like to the general audience at every
  given point in time, which means that the /modules folder still abstracts away the behind-the-scenes
  intricate details despite revealing the history of the project's mode of presentation.
- The mode of inquiry would chronologically pass through my 4 areas of interest and my 4 life modules
  to arrive at my point of insight in June/July 2025 when I conceived of this project and convinced
  myself of its robustly significant potential, and further onwards as the project continued to develop
  in my mind. It is encapsulated in my [`/appendix`](./appendix) folder.
- This backward-facing archive contains all the messy convoluted implementation details and history
  that the forward-facing presentation conceals. It is the transparent and maximal documentation of
  how the curated edition came to be. The forward-facing presentation is just the tip of the iceberg,
  such that the backward-facing documentation of the mode of inquiry outnumbers it in sheer text size
  by a factor of 10:1 or more.
- Since the /modules folder already serves to self-document its version history, the /appendix folder
  represents all the work I have done and will do behind the scenes off of GitHub that is important
  enough and personally insensitive enough to place in this public repository. This is the best
  solution I could think of to reconcile the messiness of real life non-linear research with this
  GitHub platform.

**What is my flagship product that demonstrates the provisional soundness of my project?**
- The flagship product of the **MinimaLIST** approach to the formal sciences is called **EngLISP**, an
  intermediate language that is the overlap between English as a natural language and Lisp as a programming
  language.
- It represents the underlying semantics of all natural languages in Lisp S-expressions by enforcing
  an isomorphic relationship between them and X-bar syntax trees from scientific linguistics.
- It will be used as a semantic representation to reduce LLM hallucination rates and as a Java bytecode
  kind of tool to aid translation between human languages by preserving their shared semantics.
- **EngLISP** will be readable for English readers with just a few simple rules on the use of recursively
  nested parentheses in Lisp, due to me establishing a convention to use the English lexicon for naming
  variables and data and the Lisp syntax being not only incredibly powerful but simple, regular, and clear.
- **EngLISP** will also be able to be compiled as a Lisp program with just a few metaprogramming extensions
  added to the Lisp language that I will choose.
- Without needing compilation, the LLM only needs to perform its token-by-token text-prediction on
  **EngLISP** code as a pure syntactically-minimal representation of semantics, instead of tracing
  patterns through natural language text corpuses, which leads to the LLM picking up on a lot of
  "noise" along the way due to syntactic arbitrariness.
- Translating natural language to **EngLISP** format is all that will be needed to move from optimizing
  surface-level syntactical patterns with poor correspondence to the truth to optimizing the
  patterns in the underlying semantic content, bypassing the obstacles found in raw natural language
  texts and reducing "noise" and "friction" incurred in natural language processing within and
  between natural languages.
- When operating on the newly liberated semantic content, the token-by-token text prediction algorithm
  changes from just greedy local optimization that picks the most frequent way that previous authors
  in the text corpus have completed that piece of text to greedy local optimization of the key semantic
  entities in the translated **EngLISP** code and every non-semantic irregularity stripped out.
- We know of both the fact that all natural languages are equally expressive in principle, and that all
  programming languages, including Lisp languages, in use today are Turing-equivalent.
- The result of compiling an **EngLISP** program is a different matter, and depending on the exact contents
  of the program, the fact that it compiles implies something about the logical consistency of the program,
  and additionally, the value returned by evaluating a valid Lisp S-expression written according to
  **EngLISP** standards may represent a variety of useful results, like a factual argument returning `True`
  if it is true, `False` if false, according to its own logic (its formal-logical axioms and inference
  rules), or a number for the returned value of a mathematical **EngLISP** program, or text for qualitative
  **EngLISP** programs, or even arbitrary objects or functions if that makes sense in context, like if
  the corresponding English passage would imply that return value for anyone who read it and understood
  what it was saying.
- Note that I have not provided a full qualitative description, quantitative formal grammar, translator
  that can convert natural language to **EngLISP** and back, or even a cursory fully worked out
  mockup.
- I have only provided hints to convince you to take this project seriously.

**Where did I previously base this project on the public Internet?**
- I originally hosted this MinimaLIST project on the Medium platform but I realized that GitHub suits
  my requirements better for version control, recursive nested folder organization of article-modules,
  and my system of interlinked article-modules that allow for more than one canonical traversals of
  the material I have laid out here, because much of its is modularized and that way I can only
  explain a concept or make an argument once and simply link to it if I write another article-module
  that has a dependency to it, so that there is no redundancy, there is a single authoritative source
  for each thesis and justification, and I will not have to update a bunch of files when a dependency
  shifts in meaning.
    - Otherwise, a change in my definitions would cause me to hunt down every single instance in which
      I used it and rectify it, which is tedious and prone to human error.
    - Modularity is the best way to prevent errors from propagating and isolate processes from each other,
      achieving linkage between modules only on both terms.
- Consequently, I froze my Medium blog as-is, and ported all of my relevant writings for the project
  and those immediately preceding this project into the [`/appendix`](./appendix) folder of this
  repository to serve as a publicly transparent archive, fully documented and with timestamps.
  - I mean my forward-facing writings intended for public distribution.
- I will still keep my Medium profile public since it acts as a timestamp marking the first time
  many of my project-related ideas have been publicly published on the Internet.
- I might consider using it as a peripheral platform to divert public interest towards this GitHub
  repository, which will be the central and fully sufficient forward-facing presentation and backward-facing
  archive of my **MinimaLIST** project. Medium might just be more familiar to non-technical audiences who
  might get intimidated by GitHub as a platform used to host coding projects.
- Hence, my Medium profile will just advertise updates made to this GitHub repository instead of hosting its
  own content, which would be redundant, and redundancy defeats the purpose of this project to begin with.
- For now, since I have yet to produce any article-modules, you will have to read my Medium articles in
  my /appendix archive to get the gist of how I conceive of my project right now and the concrete
  explanatory and contextual content that I will refactor as needed to produce my first few article-modules.
- Once I have squeezed out all the information from my Medium article archive that is still correct and
  up-to-date and relevant going forward, distilling them into article-modules like how I intended and
  documented here, then the role of them will become totally superfluous and obsolete, and readers would
  only need to look at them if they wanted to do backward-facing geneaological philological investigation,
  or verify timestamps.
  - The idea of doing philological archeology on GitHub is simply absurd to me though.

**Where are my laboratory notebooks?**
- My backward-facing "laboratory notebooks", i.e., my ChatGPT chat logs are voluminous, convoluted,
  private, fragmented, contradictory, non-linear, and often incorrect and unreadable or even partially
  correct and partially in error, relative to the most up-to-date version of this repository.
- Yet this is the inevitable result of a complex research endeavor, just like how Marx had to work out
  an entire succession of drafts to compose Capital, including Grundrisse, which scholars often refer
  to as his "laboratory notebooks" leading up to Capital.
- For me, they represent many deadends followed by backtracking scattered across many chunks of text,
  making it hard to follow for those without my biographical context.
- Obviously no one would be interested in reading through them without having grasped the significance of
  my project through its forward-facing modules, just like how Grundrisse had to be released posthumously
  after Capital gained a sufficient scholarship and reverence that would motivate critics of political
  economy to seek out Marx's first draft, filled with a Hegelian philosophical scaffolding and explicit
  methodology that would be dropped later, to trace the development of the categories and their ordering
  within Capital Volumes I-IV.
