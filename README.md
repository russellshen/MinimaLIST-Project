# MinimaLIST-Project
The MinimaLIST Approach to Life and Understanding Reality:
- Once a book project but now a series of interlinked article-modules hosted as a GitHub repository.
- The final goal is to concisely explain the MinimaLIST approach and then apply it to 4 concrete domains
in which I am experienced.
- I aim to uncover truths that were infeasible or impossible to access before applying the MinimaLIST
method to them.
- My flagship product of the MinimaLIST approach to the formal sciences is called EngLISP, an intermediate
language that is the overlap between English as a natural language and Lisp as a programming language.
- It represents the underlying semantics of all natural languages in Lisp S-expressions by enforcing
an isomorphic relationship between them and X-bar syntax trees from linguistics.
- It will be used as a semantic representation to reduce LLM hallucination rates and as a Java bytecode
kind of tool to aid translation between human languages by preserving their shared semantics.
